### Project Overview: Sales Data Analysis

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze sales performance using advanced data analysis techniques to uncover trends, optimize sales strategies, and improve decision-making. The analysis will focus on understanding product and regional sales performance, customer behavior, and monthly trends, leading to actionable insights.
---
### Data Source:
The dataset consists of transactional sales data with the following key columns:
- Order ID: Unique identifier for each sale.
- Customer ID: Identifier for the customer.
- Product: The item sold.
- Region: The geographic area where the sale occurred.
- Order Date: Date of the transaction.
- Quantity: The number of units sold.
- Unit Price: Price per unit of the product.
---
### Tools and Techniques:

1. Microsoft Excel:
   - Data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis.
   - Use of PivotTables and formulas to create quick summaries.
  
     
2. SQL:
   - Used for querying and aggregating data from the sales database.
   - Filtering data based on region, product, customer, and time periods.
   - Generating insights on total sales, customer segmentation, and product performance.


3. Power BI:
   - Building interactive dashboards for dynamic visualizations.
   - Visual analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, regional performance, product profitability, and customer segmentation.
   - Drill-down capabilities for exploring data in detail, filtering by time periods, and comparing different products/regions.
---
### Key Metrics:
- Total sales value (Quantity Ã— Unit Price).
- Orders per region and product.
- Sales growth trends over time.
- Top customers by sales volume.
---
### Expected Outcomes:
- Comprehensive Reports: Sales performance insights, including regional, product, and customer-based summaries.

## Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

### Project Overview: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service
### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze customer data for a subscription service to identify segments, subscription patterns, and key trends related to cancellations and renewals. This analysis will provide insights into customer behavior, subscription preferences, and factors driving churn. The final deliverable will be a Power BI dashboard that visualizes these insights, allowing stakeholders to explore the data interactively.

### Summary:
This project involves:
- Analyzing customer data to uncover patterns in subscription plans, duration, and customer retention.
- Tracking key trends such as cancellations within the first six months, popular subscription types, and overall customer activity.
- Delivering actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

### Tools and Techniques:
- Excel: Initial data analysis and summary reporting through PivotTables.
- SQL: Querying the dataset to extract insights from the subscription database
- Power BI: Visualizing the data and creating an interactive dashboard.
