### Code Used
 ```SQL
CREATE DATABASE Sales_DB;

SELECT * FROM Sales_DB.salesdata;

--Retrieve the total sales for each product category--
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product 
FROM salesdata
GROUP BY Product;

--Find the number of sales transactions in each region--
SELECT COUNT(OrderID), Region
FROM salesdata
GROUP BY Region;

--Calculate the total revenue per product--
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Total_sales_value
FROM salesdata
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Total_sales_value DESC
;

--Calculate the highest-selling product by total sales value--
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Total_sales_value
FROM salesdata
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Total_sales_value DESC
LIMIT 1
;

--Calculate monthly sales total for the current year--
 ALTER TABLE salesdata
ADD Year INT;

ALTER TABLE salesdata
ADD Month INT;

UPDATE salesdata
SET Year = YEAR(STR_TO_DATE(Orderdate, '%c/%e/%Y')),
Month = MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(Orderdate, '%c/%e/%Y'));

SELECT Month, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Total_sale_value
FROM salesdata 
WHERE Year LIKE 2024
GROUP BY 
Month
ORDER BY Month 
;

--Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount--
SELECT  Customer_id, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Total_purchase_amount
FROM salesdata
GROUP BY Customer_id
ORDER BY Total_purchase_amount DESC
LIMIT 5;

--Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region
SELECT Region,
SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Region_Sales,
(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice)/(SELECT SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) FROM salesdata )* 100) AS Percentage_of_totalsales
FROM salesdata
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Percentage_of_totalsales DESC;

--Identify products with no sales in the last quarter--
SELECT Product
FROM salesdata
GROUP BY Product
HAVING MAX(STR_TO_DATE(OrderDate, '%c/%e/%Y')) <DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 QUARTER);
